# Variations

Every Fingerprint can be composed of up to 10 properties:

1. Line counter - Number of lines per fingerprint area
2. Area - Fingerprint area in % of total area
3. Perimeter - The length of the outer curve of the papillary pattern
4. Major axis - Primary axis of the fingerprint ellipse
5. Minor axis - Secondary axis of the fingerprint ellipse
6. Angle - Angle is the angle between the primary axis and a line parallel to the X-axis of the fingerprint
7. Circularity - A value of 1.0 indicating a perfect circle
8. Integrated density - The sum of the values of the pixels in the image fingerprint
9. Skewness - The third order moment about the mean
10. Kurtosis - The fourth order moment about the mean
